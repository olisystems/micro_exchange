# Micro Exchange

## Description

As part of my master thesis I want to include a simple token micro-economy. I like to do a simple simulation where value is transferred between token owners to buy or sell a set of 5 different products. Basically what I want is to make an example with 5 to 10 different "agents" where each of them initiate with different amounts of tokens, something between 100 and 100000 tokens, after this I like to randomly set them lose to transact these values from one to another for a period of one day making transfers every minute for example. After the day is complete, I like to see statistics on a graph, then run it again for a following day and compare results. These are some of the parameters:

Number of agents 10 (each agent should have a name)

Number of products 5 (each product should have a name and price for agents to buy -and sell-)

Number of random transactions 1440 ( this is a random transaction for each minute in one day)

Token price = 1cent

To start this I am using a tutorial from MESA which is very close to what I need to do. Part of the code is here and can be used. It just needs to be modified a little.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Mesa program runs on python so make sure your computer has the following dependencies. 

```
- jupyter (Ipython interactive notebook)
- matplotlib (Python’s visualization library)
- mesa (this ABM library – if not installed)
- numpy (Python’s numerical python library)
```
### Installing required components and mesa

If you are not sure, mesa tutorial also provides a link where these can be downloaded

```
$ pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectmesa/mesa/master/examples/boltzmann_wealth_model/requirements.txt
```
Also make sure to install mesa with this line of code

```
$ pip install mesa
```
This can be done directly from a terminal screen or Python. However, for my exercise I am using Jupyter notebook. This allows to include graphs and other functions that can be presented into an easy to read document. 

###  Installing additional software for cloning 

Follow the steps below to have development environment running:
Clone the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/olisystems/alf-transparency.git
```
After this you should be able to work on the project and modify the program as needed. 

COMMENT:
### Below this point I do not thing is needed for this program

2. Change directory to `alf-transparency
` folder and install all requisite npm packages (as listed in `package.json`):
```
$ cd alf-transparency
$ npm install
```
3. Compile the smart contracts:
```
$ cd truffle
$ truffle compile
```
This will create the smart contract artifacts in folder `app\src\assets\js\contracts`.

4. Migrate smart contracts to `volta` chain:
```
$ npm run migrate
```

5. Test smart contracts:
```
$ npm run test
```

6. Compiles and hot-reloads for development, run the following command inside `app` directory:
```
$ cd app
$ npm run serve
```
Navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser.

7. Compiles and minifies for production:
```
$ npm run build
```
## Built With

- [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) - Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
- [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.7/#web3-js-ethereum-javascript-api) - A collection of libraries which allow interacting with a local or remote ethereum node, using an HTTP or IPC connection.
